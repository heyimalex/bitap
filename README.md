# bitap

Implementation of the [bitap algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitap_algorithm) for fuzzy string searching in Rust.

The code is kinda rough because this is the first Rust I've written. Initially I planned to use this to create a webassembly-backed fork of [Fuse.js](http://fusejs.io/), a fuzzy searching library that internally makes heavy use of the bitap algorithm.
